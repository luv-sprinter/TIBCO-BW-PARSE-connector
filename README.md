TIBCO-BW-PARSE-connector
========================

Trying to create a TIBCO-BW-PARSE connector which lets BW interact with parse.com and add data into the data browser of parse.

TIBCO-BW-PARSE-connector-

This is a TIBCO-BW_PARSE connector which helps you to Post,delete,get and put messages into the Parse
Currently integrated to sample app checkDB(https://www.parse.com/apps/test--6668/collections#class/checkDB).
To test yourself ,create a simple app with parse.com and change the existing url in the Invoke Rest Api activity.

dependencies:
TIBCO ACTIVEMATRIX BUSINESSWORKS PLUG-IN FOR REST AND JSON
(http://tap.tibco.com/storefront/trialware/tibco-activematrix-businessworks-plug-in-for-rest-and-json/prod15308.html)


How to Run this application
First Set The URL of PARSE >> URL to your app of parse

You could see four processes: 
1)parse_get
2)parse_post
3)parse_delete
4)parse_get


If you would like to contribute to this project. you can add other parse methods as BW process to this project and send us pull request. 

Thanks.
